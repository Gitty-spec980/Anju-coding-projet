    <h1> Puppies </h1>
    <p> A puppy is a juvenile dog, <u>generally one less than 12-18 months old.</u></p>
    
<p> Puppies are markedly underdeveloped and dependent on their mothers at birth (displaying altriciality), but healthy
    puppies grow <small>quickly</small> and begin walking thereafter. <b><mark>Puppies generally weigh 8–16 oz ( <del>0.25.</del>0.23–0.45 kg)</mark><b> </b> shortly after birth,
    depending on the breed.</p>
    
    <p> A puppy's coat colour may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in <mark>breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.</mark>
    Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, while <i>pup may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes,
    guinea pigs, rats, or sharks.</i></p>
