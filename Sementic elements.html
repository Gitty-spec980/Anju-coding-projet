                        <h2> All About Peacocks</h2>
                        <p>Peafowl is a common name for two bird species of the genus Pavo and one species of the closely related genus Afropavo
                        within the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl are referred to as
                        peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens.</p>
                        <p>The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl
                        from Southeast Asia. The third peafowl species, the Congo peafowl, is native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are
                        known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species,
                        which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual.</p>
                        
                        <p>The functions of the elaborate iridescent coloration and large "train" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive
                        scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had
                        evolved by sexual selection. More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap principle that these features acted as
                        honest signals of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with
                        such large and conspicuous structures.</p>

                        Video analysis of the mechanisms behind the display
                        The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metal-like blue and green. In both
                        species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due
                        to the "tail", also known as a "train".[1] The peacock train consists not of tail quill feathers but highly elongated
                        upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. All species have a
                        crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also
                        displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.</p>
