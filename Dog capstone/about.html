            <h2>About Dogs 🐶</h2>
            <p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in
            shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house
            around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight.</p>
            <p>Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior
            sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding,
            pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.</p>

                <h3> History about Dogs 🦴</h3>
                <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the
                domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers.</p>
                <p> Dogs
                were the first species to be domesticated over 14,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Due to their
                long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
                other canids.</p>

                <h3> Why Dogs Are Important To Humans🌈</h3>

                <p>Dogs are important to humans for their companionship, emotional support, and a variety of physical and mental health
                benefits, such as reducing stress, encouraging physical activity, and lowering the risk of loneliness.</p>
                <p>Their historical
                roles have included protection and assistance in hunting, while modern roles extend to service animals and therapy
                animals that help those with disabilities and provide comfort. The relationship between humans and dogs is a mutual one,
                where humans provide care in exchange for loyalty, protection, and affection</p>
