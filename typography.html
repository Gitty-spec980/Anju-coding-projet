        <h1>France Cuisine</h1>
        <p>French cuisine is the cooking traditions and practices of France. <mark>In the 14th century, Guillaume Tirel, a court chef
        known as "Taillevent", wrote Le Viandier, one of the earliest recipe collections of medieval France.</mark> In the 17th and
        18th centuries, chefs François Pierre La Varenne and Marie-Antoine Carême spearheaded movements that shifted French
        cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style.
        
        <p>Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many
        variations and appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.</p>
        
        <p>Culinary tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint commoners with the cuisine bourgeoise of the urban elites and
        the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Many dishes that were once regional have
        proliferated in variations across the country.</p>
        
        Knowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western
        cookery school boards and culinary education. In November 2010, French gastronomy was added by the UNESCO to its lists
        of the world's "intangible cultural heritage".</p>
