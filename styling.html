        <p> Indian food is known for its diverse regional cuisines, reliance on fresh spices, and a unique blend of six tastes. It's
        also the "land of spices," producing over 70% of the world's spices. Despite the popularity of "curry," individual
        dishes use custom spice blends, and many common ingredients like potatoes and tomatoes were introduced by the
        Portuguese.</p>
        <p>India's vast geography and cultural influences have resulted in a wide array of regional cuisines, each with its own
        unique flavors and specialties.India is the world's largest producer and exporter of spices, with a long history of using them to create complex and
        flavorful dishes.Instead of a pre-mixed "curry powder," Indian cooks create unique spice blends for each dish, using freshly ground
        spices for optimal flavor.Indian food theory emphasizes a balance of six tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, pungent (spicy), and astringent.</p>
